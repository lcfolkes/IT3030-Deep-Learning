# Repo for IT3030-Deep-Learning
## The repo consists of three large programming projects: 
**Project 1: Neural network from scratch with numpy**

**Project 2: Semi-supervised learning model in Keras and Pytorch**

**Project 3: Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) in Keras. Also a small literature review on Mode Collapse in GANs**
