# [IT3030-Deep-Learning](https://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/it3030/)
## The repo consists of three large programming projects, counting 60% towards the final grade in the subject: 
**Project 1:** Vanilla Neural Network from scratch with numpy

**Project 2:** Semi-supervised learning model in Keras and Pytorch

**Project 3:** Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) in Keras. Also a small literature review on Mode Collapse in GANs
